The purpose of this is to make https://streambk.com open source, but we can't guarantee that we will fully transition to it. We would like to start off by open sourcing the front end and then the backend.

One of the following this we would like to use for the front end is:

- **pnpm**
- **React 18** & **Vite**
- **Tailwindcss** and or maybe **styled-components**
- **simple-core-state** or any other state lib that is simple to use and works with the basics
